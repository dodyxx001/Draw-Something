This project was a part of The Odin Project curriculum.
We recieved only basic instructions, what sould we build.
All the steps, HTML, CSS and JS editing we had to figure out on our own.

The instructions were to use either CSS flexbox or grid to create a 32 x 32 grid
of boxes.
Then we had to enable coloring the boxes, and adding a "clear" button.
We had to add "random color" option, to color the boxes with random colors.
How to complete all these steps was not specified.

I started with creating the grid wih CSS grid, inside the script file. Then 
I added various event-listeners to the boxes, for example mouse-down, mouse-over
and mouse-up, to color them by adding a class.
To change the grid size, I added a slider, which on value-change deletes the grid 
and creates a new grid, with width and height equal to slider's value.
I also added a 'erasing' cehckbox which when checked, deletes the colored
boxes in the same manner as we draw over the empty ones.

This was fun but quite challenging task, taking in account that I've been learning 
JavaScript for only about 40 days.
The project took about 10 hours to finish.
